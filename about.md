Although I work as a web designer, I love living in the country with my wonderful wife, Megan. We have a couple dozen cattle, two sheep, a dog and two crazy cats. When we aren't doing something outside, we love to cook. Here's a little bit more about my professional background.

## BriteCore
At BriteCore, I'm responsible for all aspect's of our app's design and visual direction. This means I do everything from initial sketches of new functionality to architecting our SCSS structure. Above all else, though, my focus is on creating a great User Experience for our app. BriteCore is a great company to work for, and I'm constantly learning more about design.

## MidwayUSA
As a web designer at MidwayUSA, I worked on a team during the overhaul of our checkout process, and I led the redesign of our account management page. For both of these, and other projects, we adhered to industry best practices and conducted internal user testing.

## Journalism
Before becoming a digital designer, I studied journalism at the University of Missouri. It taught me some great lessons about communication, and I still consider myself a tough editor. While at MU, I also worked in several newsrooms. It's still hard to beat the feeling of working on Election Night, piecing together the day's news.
