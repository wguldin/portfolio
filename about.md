Although I work for a tech-driven insurance software company, I love living in the country with my wonderful wife, Megan. We have a farm with cattle, sheep, and a couple dogs and cats.

When we aren't doing something outside, we love to cook together. Working for a remote company has given me a great opportunity to work with brillant people across the world, and let us have the kind of life we wanted for our daughter.

Like most folks, my path to working on digital products was winding. I went to the University of Missouri to study Journalism. Working on stories, and in a newsroom, taught me some great lessons about communication, and I still consider myself a tough editor. Being introduced to copy editing also led to me learning about print design, and ultimately magazine design was the focus of my graduate degree.

While in school, I started to teach myself HTML & CSS, and used these skills to build out small micro sites for several journalism projecs. That served as my first introduction to digital design, and the principles of user experience.

From there, I worked as a web designer for a large online retailer, and then was lucky enough to find the position at BriteCore. For full details about my experience, you can check out my resume, or read my case studies. 

As far as other interests go, the farm does keep Megan and I busy, but I also enjoy woodworking (I built a chicken coop!), reading (usually non-fiction), and video games (playing mostly Stellaris now).
