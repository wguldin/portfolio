Like most people, I mostly learned on my own about web design, and google came in really handy.


It's always impressed how much great information is out there about web design.




For most of my short career, I felt like I didn't have anything much to say that wasn't already being said by a lot of talented folks. At my first job, I worked for a company that sold things online. If there's one area of web design that's well researched, that's it.
