In my role at BriteCore, I've had several opportunities to present to different audiences, including presenting every year on product design at our annual users conference, BriteCon.

## BriteCon 2019
While scaling our design team at BriteCore, we created a dedicted role for user research. Over the course of the year, we engaged with real people using our application in new ways, and I talk about how that's worked, and what we're planning on next.

## Tech Talk "CSS: Itâ€™s not that complicated"
Because of my background as a web designer, I've learned a fair bit around best practices related to CSS. Since most of BriteCore's developers are full stack, and haven't worked in CSS extensively, I thought this might be a good subject for a company tech talk.

## BriteCon 2018 - Design
In 2018, we had just started to scale our design team, so I outlined how this team would work with people using our application, and I described what the design process looks like.

## BriteCon 2017 - Custom Quoting for a Better UX
In 2016/2017, I was deeply involved in a rewrite of our quoting process that agents go through. In the process, we found there was a large amount of demand for more customized quoting workflows for agents. I talk about some of the best practices and functionailty we were able to add to the system.
